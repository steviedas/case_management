- Need to add extra status for "Proposed" cases which will be created automatically from queries
- Some inputs are driven from TOC filling out MS Form. It is difficult and process is falling down at the moment (opportunity to solve this with the app)
- Diagram to be used as dynamic scrolling across Units and then highlight based on accepted vs proposed cases against a sub-system on the vehicle
- Case -> Work Orders is Many -> Many
- Olivia to rebaseline schedule
- Leave Unit filter in
- Symptoms important to see proportion of cases against fleet
