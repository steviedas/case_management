To confirm moving forward the ‘FRP’ will be renamed ‘IntelliRail’.

The FRP will now sit as a widget under the IntelliRail system, alongside the new case management tool. Moving forward any new dashboards or development that take place will sit as a widget within IntelliRail and we will utilise role permissions both internally and externally to manage user access, another example of this will be the engine idling tool.

Please confirm alignment on the above and make required changes to the newly developed case management system as discussed.

Regards

Olivia Wallace
