- expectation is first case management release on Monday 12th Jan
- ability to right-click the engine intervention page to edit an intervention rather than scrolling to the right of the table and clicking edit button must be added as a requirement (agreed previously)
- request has been added to merge the 'Records' and 'Meeting Notes' into a single tab rather than 2 x tabs.
